Hello my name is Suzane Muza. This app is to help those we need to make a quick list for their everyday life. I busy soccer mom, assistant or manager or just the average person can use this app. How it works is you can create an account then make a to-do list or a grocery list. There is even a calender feature if a user needs to do something on a particular day. Creating a new list will be easy because there is a button on the sidebar that will let you do that. Overall this app is used to make someone's life easier and npt to be super hard to use I want to make it so easy even a child can use it. You will be seeing the code for the home page, how to create a new list, the nav bar features, and contact page. 

In the future I would like to make the add different features like maybe uplaoding pictures for the users and make the app more interactive.Voice activation is also something I would think about adding to the specs of the app. I would love the voice activation feature for the app because it will allow the user to use the app like Siri and and say a command and the command will be added to their list!

I used codesandebox, with some css, React, React-Router, React-Redux to do this project.
